VS Code extension for [oja-action](https://github.com/eBay/oja/blob/master/packages/oja-action#readme) dependency injection layer with action discovery and code completion.

This modue is a subset of [Oja](https://github.com/eBay/oja#readme) framework.

With the introduction of dependency injection, we lose the ability to easily navigate the code through import links.

This VS Code extension brings us back this functionality and even more - you can now view all reachable actions from the given point in a popup window.

The extension also does automatic validations for your project upon saving.
